# Calcium imaging + Ephys codebase for EC in the Williams Lab (McGill)
This is a general purpose codebase and sandbox for loading, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing simultaneous calcium and electrophysiology data. This codebase is a work in progress but feel free to grab any parts that you might find useful. If I messed up on something let me know.

[The name "CEH2" is a terrible joke, see if you can figure it out.  If you did, I'm so sorry].  

## Dependencies
At the moment the codebase still makes use of the extensive [van der meer lab codebase](https://github.com/vandermeerlab/vandermeerlab) for Ephys functions and general utilities until I actually write my own...
